# "<em>Graph Colorings as Network Reliability</em>"

This codebase is meant to store various algorithms to assist in the Network Reliability project, which originally came about from a Summer REU project. Using SageMaths Graph data structure, this code try's to generate information about the minimum number of vertex or edge removals are required to get a given graph down to a vertex or edge coloring under a specific value. When doing so over large graphs or many graphs this becomes a very big task, thus attention has been given to take advantage of pre-computation and multi-threading.

See MinMax2Demo.ipynb for a breakdown of the functions written in the MinMax2 Module.
